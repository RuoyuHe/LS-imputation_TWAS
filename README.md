# Enhancing nonlinear transcriptome- and proteome-wide association studies via trait imputation with applications to Alzheimer's disease
This repository contains the code used for the analysis in [Enhancing nonlinear transcriptome- and proteome-wide association studies via trait imputation with applications to Alzheimer's disease].


## Description
The code is organized into four main parts:
1. **ADSP Analysis**: `./adsp` contains the `R` and `Python` code for the analysis presented in the Section 3.3 of the main text. `./adsp/FUSION/` contains the code for the anlysis presented in the Supplementary Section 5.
2. **HDL Proof-of-concept**: `./hdl` contains the `R` and `Python` code for the analysis presented in Section 3.2 of the main text.
3. **Simulations**: `./simulation/code` contains the simulation code.
4. **Results**: `./results` contains the results files for the real data analyses.
